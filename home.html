              NetC19 is a thermal screening solution that enables a business,
              construction or industrial concern to screen its staff/customers
              entering a plant or facility by screening their temperature,
              logging their contact information and keeping a log of their
              movement in and out of the facility or facilities in question. The
              onsite data is live-streamed to the cloud host, enabling
              management to follow site statistics and access staff/customers
              records for risk mitigation across a spectrum of facilities
              located at different geographical addresses.
